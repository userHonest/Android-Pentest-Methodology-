# OWASP ZAP 

## Crafting and converting ZAP certiificate to binary and push to phone.

### Get certificate from ZAP

`Tools -> Options ->  Server certificates -> Save `

The file will be  `zap_root_ca.cer`

## Create the Phone certificate

The command reads the zap_root_ca.cer file, which is in PEM format, and writes its content to a new file named zap.pem. 
Essentially, this command is converting or copying the PEM-formatted certificate from one file to another.

`openssl x509 -inform PEM -in zap_root_ca.cer -out zap.pem`

Extract the hash from the pem file

`openssl x509 -inform PEM -subject_hash_old -in zap.pem | head -1 `                      

You will get this type of result

`f22f4bb8`

Change the name to 

`mv zap.pem f22f4bb8.0`

Then push to the phone and follow the steps from burpsuite.
